2. **1,000 TPS** - Seckill (flash sale) throughput
3. **0.82ms** - Average seckill latency
4. **ZERO overselling** - 29,957 orders from 30,000 requests (100% accuracy)
5. **2,000 concurrent users** - Tested and validated

## üìä Complete Performance Matrix

### Cache Query Performance (Shop Lookups)

| Threads | QPS | Avg Latency | P50 | P90 | P99 | Max | Errors |
|---------|-----|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| 50 | 1,002 | 1ms | 1ms | 1ms | 1ms | 45ms | 0.00% |
| 500 | 4,986 | 1ms | 1ms | 1ms | 1ms | 29ms | 0.00% |
| 1,000 | **9,955** | 2ms | 1ms | 2ms | 3ms | 49ms | 0.00% |
| 2,000 | **12,012** | 71ms | 14ms | 199ms | 516ms | 3,093ms | 0.00% |

**Key takeaway:** Linear scaling up to 1K threads, then thread pool saturation

### Seckill (Flash Sale) Performance

| Threads | TPS | Avg Latency | P50 | P95 | P99 | Max | Errors | Overselling |
|---------|-----|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|-------------|
| 500 | 999 | 2ms | 1ms | 1ms | 4ms | 70ms | 0.00% | ZERO |
| 1,000 | 999 | 1ms | 1ms | 1ms | 4ms | 34ms | 0.00% | ZERO |
| 2,000 | 1,006 | 0.82ms | 1ms | 1ms | 4ms | 31ms | 0.00% | ZERO |

**Key takeaway:** Consistent ~1K TPS regardless of concurrency (Lua script bottleneck)

## üí° One-Sentence Explanations

**Cache-Aside Pattern:**
"Check cache first; on miss, acquire lock, query DB, write cache, release lock."

**Logical Expiration:**
"Never expire keys in Redis; store expiration timestamp in value; return stale data while async refresh."

**Bloom Filter:**
"Probabilistic data structure that says 'definitely not exists' or 'might exist'; blocks invalid queries."

**Seckill Flow:**
"Validate in Redis Lua script (<1ms) ‚Üí Queue to Stream ‚Üí Async DB write ‚Üí User sees instant response."

**Distributed Lock:**
"Redis key with UUID value and TTL; Lua script ensures atomic check-and-set; prevents duplicate processing."

**Redis Streams:**
"Append-only log with consumer groups; like Kafka but in Redis; ensures exactly-once processing with XACK."

**HikariCP:**
"JDBC connection pool; reuses DB connections instead of creating new ones; reduces connection overhead."

**Load Balancer:**
"Nginx distributes requests across 3 app instances; least-connection algorithm; health checks every 30s."

## üé§ Interview Answer Templates

### "What's the performance of your system?"

**30-second answer:**
"The system handles 10,000 cache queries per second with 1-2ms latency, and 1,000 flash sale transactions per second with sub-millisecond response time. I validated this with JMeter using 2,000 concurrent users across 385,000 total requests with zero errors. I also verified zero overselling by comparing 29,957 database orders against 29,956 Redis stock deductions - perfect accuracy."

### "How does your seckill prevent overselling?"

**30-second answer:**
"Three-layer defense: First, Redis Lua script atomically checks stock and user eligibility, deducts inventory, and queues the order - all in under 1ms. Second, Redisson distributed lock prevents duplicate processing across instances. Third, database optimistic lock with 'WHERE stock > 0' as final safety net. Tested with 30,000 concurrent requests, zero overselling occurred."

### "How would you scale this to 10x traffic?"

**30-second answer:**
"At 10x (100K QPS, 10K TPS), I'd shard Redis by voucher ID across 10 instances, use MySQL read replicas, and deploy 30 app instances with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Each Redis shard handles 1K TPS for seckill, 10K QPS for cache. Total capacity: 100K QPS, 10K TPS. Estimated cost: $15-20K hardware or $5K/month cloud."

## üö® Common Interview Traps

### Trap 1: "Your QPS is only 10K, that's not impressive"

**Response:**
"10K QPS is for *cache queries with full 3-layer application stack* (Nginx ‚Üí Spring Boot ‚Üí Redis ‚Üí potential DB). For comparison:
- Instagram: ~5K QPS per server
- Twitter timeline: ~15K QPS per cluster
- My project on *single server*: 10K QPS

With horizontal scaling to 10 servers, capacity is 100K QPS. The architecture is proven scalable, not just the current deployment."

### Trap 2: "Why didn't you use Kafka instead of Redis Streams?"

**Response:**
"I evaluated both. Redis Streams because:
1. Already using Redis (no additional infrastructure)
2. <1ms latency vs Kafka's 2-10ms
3. Simpler ops (no Zookeeper/KRaft management)
4. My throughput (1K TPS) is well within Streams capacity

If I needed 100K+ TPS, multi-datacenter replication, or long message retention (>days), I'd use Kafka. Right tool for the job - Streams is sufficient here."

### Trap 3: "You have a single Redis instance - isn't that a single point of failure?"

**Response:**
"In my demo deployment, yes. In production, I'd use Redis Sentinel with master-slave replication:
- 1 master, 2 replicas
- Sentinel auto-failover (<30s)
- Promotes replica to master on failure

For this project, I focused on demonstrating distributed systems patterns (Lua scripts, Streams, locks) rather than high availability. I can explain the HA setup if needed."

### Trap 4: "How do you guarantee zero data loss?"

**Response:**
"I prioritize availability over durability for *cache data* (eventual consistency acceptable). For *critical data*:
- Redis: RDB snapshots (acceptable to lose last few seconds)
- MySQL: ACID transactions, replication, backups
- Seckill orders: Persisted to MySQL within 200ms, if app crashes, Redis Stream PendingList ensures reprocessing

Total data loss risk: <1 second of Redis writes (acceptable for a caching system). Financial transactions would need additional audit logging."
