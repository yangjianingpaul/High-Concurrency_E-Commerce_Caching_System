## 🎯 Top 20 Interview Questions

### 1. "Tell me about this project"

**Good Answer (30-second elevator pitch):**

"This is a production-grade high-concurrency e-commerce caching system I built to demonstrate my expertise in distributed systems. It solves three critical problems: cache avalanche, cache penetration, and cache breakdown.

The system handles 10,000 queries per second for product lookups and 1,000 transactions per second for flash sales with zero overselling. I implemented this using Redis for caching, Lua scripts for atomic operations, and Redis Streams for asynchronous processing.

I validated the performance with JMeter load testing using 2,000 concurrent users and verified zero overselling by comparing database records with Redis operations. The architecture uses 3 Spring Boot instances behind Nginx for high availability."

**Follow-up points to mention if asked:**
- Based on my experience at HUAWEI working on e-commerce systems
- Implemented advanced patterns beyond production requirements
- Full monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Complete performance testing documentation

### 2. "Why did you use Redis instead of other caching solutions?"

**Answer:**

"I chose Redis for five key reasons:

1. **Rich Data Structures**: I needed Sets for order deduplication, Streams for async queues, Geo for location queries, and Bitmaps for check-ins. Memcached only supports key-value.

2. **Lua Script Support**: Critical for atomic seckill operations. I can combine stock check, deduction, and queueing in a single atomic operation to prevent race conditions.

3. **Persistence**: Redis offers RDB snapshots. If the cache server restarts, I don't lose all data. This reduces database load during recovery.

4. **Single-threaded Model**: Actually a benefit for my use case. Because Redis is single-threaded, Lua scripts are inherently atomic without additional locking overhead.

5. **Production Battle-tested**: Redis is proven at scale (Twitter, GitHub, Stack Overflow all use it). For a system handling potential overselling issues, I wanted a mature solution."

**Possible follow-up: "What about Redis Cluster vs single instance?"**

"For my current scale (10K QPS), a single Redis instance is sufficient. Redis can handle 100K+ ops/sec on modern hardware. I would consider Redis Cluster when:
- QPS exceeds 50-80K consistently
- Dataset exceeds RAM capacity (need sharding)
- Need geographic distribution for latency

For production, I'd start with Master-Replica for high availability, then move to Cluster only if sharding is needed."

---

### 3. "How do you prevent overselling in the seckill feature?"

**Answer (This is THE most important question - take your time):**

"I prevent overselling using a three-layer defense strategy:

**Layer 1: Redis Lua Script (Primary Defense)**
```lua
-- Atomic operation - all or nothing
if redis.call('get', stockKey) <= 0 then
    return 1  -- Fail: no stock
end
if redis.call('sismember', orderKey, userId) == 1 then
    return 2  -- Fail: duplicate order
end
redis.call('incrby', stockKey, -1)  -- Deduct stock
redis.call('sadd', orderKey, userId)  -- Track user
redis.call('xadd', 'stream.orders', ...)  -- Queue order
return 0  -- Success
```

Why it works:
- Redis is single-threaded, so no concurrent execution
- All operations are atomic - either all succeed or all fail
- Stock check and deduction happen in same operation
- Response time: <1ms

**Layer 2: Distributed Lock (Secondary Defense)**

When the background worker processes orders from the Redis Stream, it acquires a Redisson distributed lock per user:

```java
RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock("lock:order:" + userId);
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    try {
        // Process order
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```

This prevents:
- Duplicate processing if a service restarts
- Race conditions across multiple instances
- Same user placing multiple orders simultaneously

**Layer 3: Database Optimistic Lock (Final Defense)**

```java
seckillVoucherService.update()
    .setSql("stock = stock - 1")
    .eq("voucher_id", voucherId)
    .gt("stock", 0)  // WHERE stock > 0
    .update();
```

The `stock > 0` condition acts as optimistic locking. If stock reaches zero, the UPDATE affects 0 rows, transaction rolls back.

**Test Results:**
- 30,000 requests sent
- 29,957 orders created
- 29,956 stock deducted in Redis
- Zero duplicates, zero negative stock
- 100% accuracy verified"

**Possible follow-up: "Why not just use database locking?"**

"Database locking (pessimistic or optimistic) would work, but:

1. **Performance**: Database locks have 50-200ms latency vs Redis Lua at <1ms
2. **Scalability**: Database becomes bottleneck at 1K+ TPS. MySQL handles ~5-10K concurrent connections max, but with locks, effective TPS drops to hundreds
3. **User Experience**: Users wait 200ms+ for response vs <1ms with Redis
4. **Database Protection**: By validating in Redis first, only valid requests hit the database. This protects the database from being overwhelmed.

In my design, the database lock is the *final safety net*, not the primary mechanism. This is called *defense in depth*."

---

### 4. "Explain your cache strategies and when to use each"

**Answer:**

"I implemented three different caching strategies because different scenarios require different trade-offs:

**Strategy 1: Cache-Aside with Mutex Lock**
- **Use case**: Normal shop queries, user data
- **Pattern**: Check cache → Miss? Acquire lock → Query DB → Write cache
- **Solves**: Cache breakdown (hotspot key expiration)
- **Trade-off**: Cache miss takes 50-100ms, but prevents DB stampede

Example scenario: Popular shop page expires. First request locks, queries DB, updates cache. Other 1000 requests wait 50ms instead of all hitting DB.

**Strategy 2: Logical Expiration**
- **Use case**: Ultra-hot keys, homepage data
- **Pattern**: Never expire in Redis, store expiration timestamp in value
- **Solves**: Cache avalanche, ensures 100% cache hit rate
- **Trade-off**: Users might see stale data for brief period

Example: Homepage shop list. Even if 'expired', return cached data immediately while async refresh happens. User sees data in <1ms vs 100ms cache rebuild.

```java
RedisData data = get(key);
if (!data.isExpired()) {
    return data.getData();
}
// Expired but return stale data
if (tryLock(key)) {
    async(() -> refreshCache(key));
}
return data.getData();  // Return stale immediately
```

**Strategy 3: Null Value Caching + Bloom Filter**
- **Use case**: Preventing malicious queries
- **Pattern**: Cache NULL results for 2 minutes, use Bloom filter to pre-check
- **Solves**: Cache penetration (queries for non-existent data)
- **Trade-off**: Memory for Bloom filter, 2 min stale NULL results

Example: Attacker queries shop ID 9999999 (doesn't exist). Bloom filter blocks it instantly. If Bloom filter false positive, query DB once, cache NULL for 2 min.

**When to use which:**
- **Frequently read, rarely updated**: Logical expiration
- **Balanced read/write**: Mutex lock
- **Under attack or high invalid query rate**: Bloom filter + null cache

My system uses ALL THREE because an e-commerce platform faces all these scenarios."

---

### 5. "How did you test the system's performance?"

**Answer:**

"I conducted comprehensive performance testing using Apache JMeter with four progressively increasing load levels:

**Test Environment:**
- Hardware: Intel i5-12600KF (10-core), 32GB RAM, NVMe SSD
- Setup: 3 Spring Boot instances + Nginx LB + MySQL 8.0 + Redis 7.2
- Test Data: 102K users, 50K shops, 110 seckill vouchers

**Test Matrix:**

| Test | Threads | Loops | Total Requests | Feature Tested |
|------|---------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Baseline | 50 | 100 | 5,000 | Cache queries |
| Medium | 500 | 100 | 50,000 | Cache queries |
| High | 1,000 | 100 | 100,000 | Cache queries |
| Stress | 2,000 | 100 | 200,000 | Cache queries |
| Seckill-500 | 500 | 20 | 10,000 | Flash sale |
| Seckill-1K | 1,000 | 10 | 10,000 | Flash sale |
| Seckill-2K | 2,000 | 5 | 10,000 | Flash sale |

**Key Findings:**
- Cache QPS scales linearly up to 10K (1,000 threads)
- Beyond 2K threads, thread pool saturation causes latency increase
- Seckill TPS consistent at ~1K regardless of concurrency (Lua script bottleneck)
- Zero errors across all 385,000 test requests

**Validation:**
- Compared database order count vs Redis stock reduction
- 29,957 orders created = 29,956 stock deducted (100% accuracy)
- Used Grafana to monitor JVM, connection pools, cache hit rates during tests

**Reports Generated:**
- JMeter HTML reports with response time distribution
- Grafana dashboard screenshots
- Complete documentation in PERFORMANCE_TEST_REPORT.md"

**Follow-up: "Why did seckill TPS stay at 1,000?"**

"The bottleneck is intentional - it's the Lua script execution time. Each script execution takes ~1ms and Redis is single-threaded, so max throughput is ~1,000 ops/sec.

To scale higher, I'd need to:
1. **Shard by voucher ID**: Hash voucher ID to different Redis instances
2. **Pre-deduct in batches**: Deduct 100 stock at a time to reduce Lua calls
3. **Accept eventual consistency**: Validate in Redis, write to DB async without second check

But for my use case, 1,000 TPS handles most flash sales. Taobao's biggest flash sales are ~10K TPS, which I could achieve with 10 Redis shards."

### 6. "How does your async order processing work?"

**Answer:**

"I use Redis Streams for reliable asynchronous order processing with these characteristics:

**Producer Side (In Seckill Lua Script):**
```lua
redis.call('xadd', 'stream.orders', '*',
    'userId', userId,
    'voucherId', voucherId,
    'id', orderId)
```

**Consumer Side (Background Thread):**
```java
@PostConstruct
private void init() {
    SECKILL_ORDER_EXECUTOR.submit(new VoucherOrderHandler());
}

// Infinite loop reading from Stream
List<MapRecord> list = stringRedisTemplate.opsForStream().read(
    Consumer.from("g1", "c1"),
    StreamReadOptions.empty().count(1).block(Duration.ofSeconds(2)),
    StreamOffset.create("stream.orders", ReadOffset.lastConsumed())
);
```

**Why Redis Streams over RabbitMQ/Kafka:**

1. **Simplicity**: Already using Redis, no additional infrastructure
2. **Persistence**: Messages persist even if consumer crashes
3. **Consumer Groups**: Built-in load balancing across multiple consumers
4. **Exactly-once**: XACK ensures message processed exactly once
5. **Performance**: <1ms latency for XADD

**Reliability Features:**

**Pending List Handling:**
If consumer crashes before ACK, message goes to pending list. On restart, consumer processes pending list first:

```java
private void handlePendingList() {
    while (true) {
        List<MapRecord> list = stringRedisTemplate.opsForStream().read(
            Consumer.from("g1", "c1"),
            StreamReadOptions.empty().count(1),
            StreamOffset.create("stream.orders", ReadOffset.from("0"))
        );
        if (list == null || list.isEmpty()) break;
        processOrder(list.get(0));
        acknowledge(list.get(0));
    }
}
```

**Distributed Lock During Processing:**
```java
RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock("lock:order:" + userId);
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    // Process order
    createVoucherOrder(order);
    lock.unlock();
}
```

**Benefits over synchronous processing:**
- User gets response in <1ms vs 100ms
- Database writes don't block user requests
- Can handle burst traffic (queue buffers requests)
- Graceful degradation (if DB slow, queue grows, but users unaffected)

**Trade-off:**
- Eventual consistency - order appears in DB 50-200ms after user sees success
- Need monitoring for queue depth (alert if queue > 10K messages)"

### 7. "What would break if you had 10x more traffic?"

**Answer (Shows you understand scalability):**

"At 10x traffic (100K QPS cache, 10K TPS seckill), here are the bottlenecks and my solutions:

**Bottleneck 1: Single Redis Instance**
- Current: 10K QPS, Redis can theoretically do 100K+
- At 100K QPS: CPU saturation, network bandwidth limit (~1Gbps)
- **Solution**: Redis Cluster with sharding
  - Shard by shop ID for cache queries
  - Shard by voucher ID for seckill
  - 10 shards = 10K QPS each = 100K total

**Bottleneck 2: MySQL Writes**
- Current: ~1K writes/sec (seckill orders)
- At 10K writes/sec: InnoDB lock contention, disk I/O saturation
- **Solution**:
  - Master-slave replication (read replicas)
  - Batch inserts (insert 100 orders in single transaction)
  - Consider NoSQL for order history (Cassandra, MongoDB)

**Bottleneck 3: Lua Script Execution**
- Current: Single Redis instance = max 1K Lua executions/sec
- At 10K TPS: Need 10 Redis instances
- **Solution**:
  - Shard seckill vouchers across 10 Redis instances
  - Consistent hashing by voucher ID
  - Each handles 1K TPS = 10K total

**Bottleneck 4: Network Bandwidth**
- Current: ~200 MB/s (Nginx + 3 apps + Redis + MySQL)
- At 10x: ~2 GB/s - exceeds 1Gbps NIC
- **Solution**:
  - 10Gbps NIC
  - Or distribute across multiple servers (horizontal scaling)

**Bottleneck 5: Application Instances**
- Current: 3 instances × 200 threads = 600 concurrent requests
- At 10x: Need 30 instances or optimize per-instance capacity
- **Solution**:
  - Kubernetes auto-scaling (HPA based on CPU/memory)
  - Or increase threads to 500/instance (if CPU allows)
  - Use non-blocking I/O (WebFlux) for higher concurrency per thread

**Architecture at 100K QPS:**
```
                [Nginx LB]
                     │
      ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
      │              │              │
[10 App Pods] [10 App Pods] [10 App Pods] (K8s)
      │              │              │
      ├──────────────┴──────────────┤
      │                             │
[Redis Cluster]              [MySQL Cluster]
 10 shards                    1 master + 5 replicas
```

**Cost Estimate:**
- Current: ~$2.5K hardware
- 10x: ~$15K-20K (economies of scale, not linear)
- Cloud: ~$5K/month (AWS r6g.2xlarge × 15)"

### 8. "Explain how distributed ID generation works"

**Answer:**

"I implemented distributed ID generation using Redis INCR with timestamp + sequence pattern. Here's how:

**Structure:**
```
64-bit ID = [Timestamp: 31 bits][Counter: 32 bits]
```

**Implementation:**
```java
public long nextId(String keyPrefix) {
    // 1. Get current timestamp (seconds since epoch)
    LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
    long nowSecond = now.toEpochSecond(ZoneOffset.UTC);
    long timestamp = nowSecond - BEGIN_TIMESTAMP;  // Offset from 2022-01-01

    // 2. Generate sequence number for this second
    // Key format: "icr:order:2025:10:20"
    String date = now.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy:MM:dd"));
    long count = stringRedisTemplate.opsForValue()
        .increment("icr:" + keyPrefix + ":" + date);

    // 3. Combine timestamp and sequence
    return timestamp << 32 | count;
}
```

**Why this approach:**

1. **Distributed**: Multiple instances can call this without coordination
2. **Ordered**: IDs increase over time (useful for database indexing)
3. **High Performance**: Redis INCR is O(1), ~100K ops/sec
4. **No Conflicts**: Even if 2 instances call at exact same millisecond, Redis INCR is atomic
5. **Information Rich**: Can extract timestamp from ID for debugging

**Example IDs:**
```
515385561440059393
│     │    └─ Counter: 59393 (59,393rd order today)
│     └────── Timestamp bits
└─────────── Full 64-bit ID
```

**Capacity:**
- 31 bits for timestamp = 2^31 seconds = 68 years
- 32 bits for counter = 2^32 IDs/second = 4 billion/second (way more than needed)
- Daily keys auto-expire after 30 days to save memory

**Alternatives I considered:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **UUID** | Simple, no coordination | 128-bit (wastes space), not ordered, poor DB index performance |
| **Snowflake** | Twitter-proven | Need to manage worker IDs, more complex setup |
| **Database AUTO_INCREMENT** | Simple | Single point of failure, doesn't scale |
| **Redis INCR (my choice)** | Fast, simple, distributed | Need Redis (but already using it) |

**Production considerations:**
- Redis persistence (RDB) needed to not lose counter on restart
- Could add machine ID if need to trace which server generated ID
- For multiple data centers, add datacenter ID to avoid collisions"

### 9. "How do you monitor this system in production?"

**Answer:**

"I implemented full-stack observability using Prometheus and Grafana. Here's the monitoring stack:

**1. Application Metrics (Spring Boot Actuator + Micrometer):**

Exposed via `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint:
```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info,prometheus,metrics
```

**Key Metrics Collected:**
- **JVM Metrics**:
  - Heap memory usage (watch for memory leaks)
  - GC frequency and duration (alert if GC >500ms)
  - Thread count (alert if approaching max 200)

- **HTTP Metrics**:
  - Request rate (TPS)
  - Response time (P50, P95, P99)
  - Error rate (4xx, 5xx)
  - Active connections

- **Database Metrics** (HikariCP):
  - Connection pool usage (alert if >90% utilization)
  - Query execution time
  - Pending connection requests

- **Redis Metrics** (Lettuce):
  - Command latency
  - Connection pool usage
  - Cache hit rate

**2. Prometheus Configuration:**

Scrape interval: 15s
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-apps'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['app-1:8081', 'app-2:8081', 'app-3:8081']
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
```

**3. Grafana Dashboards:**

Imported 4 production dashboards:
- **JVM Dashboard (ID: 4701)**: Memory, GC, threads
- **Spring Boot Stats (ID: 6756)**: HTTP metrics, endpoints
- **MySQL Overview (ID: 7362)**: Queries, connections, locks
- **Redis Dashboard (ID: 11835)**: Memory, operations, latency

**4. Alerting Rules:**

Critical alerts I'd set up in production:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: application_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
        for: 2m
        annotations:
          summary: "Error rate > 5% for 2 minutes"

      - alert: HighP99Latency
        expr: http_server_requests_seconds{quantile="0.99"} > 1.0
        for: 5m
        annotations:
          summary: "P99 latency > 1s for 5 minutes"

      - alert: ConnectionPoolExhausted
        expr: hikaricp_connections_active / hikaricp_connections_max > 0.9
        for: 3m
        annotations:
          summary: "Connection pool >90% for 3 minutes"

      - alert: RedisDown
        expr: up{job="redis"} == 0
        for: 1m
        annotations:
          summary: "Redis unreachable"
```

**5. Logs:**

Centralized logging (would use ELK in production):
- Application logs: JSON format for parsing
- Nginx access logs: Response times, status codes
- MySQL slow query log: Queries >100ms

**6. Health Checks:**

Multiple levels:
- Nginx → App: Every 30s
- Docker → Containers: `HEALTHCHECK` command
- K8s (if deployed): Liveness & readiness probes

**What I'd monitor during a flash sale:**
1. Real-time TPS (expect spike to 1K)
2. Redis Stream queue depth (alert if >10K messages)
3. Error rate (must stay 0%)
4. P99 latency (target <50ms)
5. Database connection pool (shouldn't max out)

This gives me full visibility from user request → Nginx → App → Redis → MySQL and back."

### 10. "Why use Redisson instead of your custom Redis lock?"

**Answer:**

"I actually implemented BOTH - a custom Lua-based lock (MutexRedisLock) AND Redisson - to demonstrate understanding of distributed locking. Let me compare:

**My Custom Lock (MutexRedisLock):**
```java
// Lock acquisition (Lua script)
if redis.call('exists', lockKey) == 0 then
    redis.call('set', lockKey, uuid, 'EX', ttl)
    return 1
else
    return 0
end

// Lock release (Lua script)
if redis.call('get', lockKey) == uuid then
    return redis.call('del', lockKey)
else
    return 0
end
```

**What it does RIGHT:**
✅ Atomic operations via Lua
✅ UUID prevents wrong owner from releasing
✅ TTL prevents deadlocks

**What it does WRONG:**
❌ No reentrant support (same thread can't acquire twice)
❌ No retry mechanism
❌ No watchdog (lock expires even if still processing)
❌ No master-slave failover handling

**Redisson Lock:**
```java
RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock("lock:order:" + userId);
boolean acquired = lock.tryLock();
```

**What Redisson adds:**

1. **Reentrant**: Same thread can acquire multiple times
2. **Watchdog**: Auto-extends lock if task not done (30s default)
3. **Fair Lock Option**: FIFO order for fairness
4. **Red Lock Algorithm**: Works across multiple Redis masters
5. **Async/Reactive**: Non-blocking lock options

**When I use each:**

| Scenario | Use | Reason |
|----------|-----|--------|
| **Cache rebuild** | Custom lock | Short operation (<1s), simple is fine |
| **Order processing** | Redisson | Long operation, need watchdog |
| **High-traffic** | Redisson | Battle-tested, production-proven |
| **Learning** | Custom lock | Understand how it works under the hood |

**In production, I'd use Redisson because:**
- Handles edge cases I haven't thought of
- Maintained by experts (Nikita Koksharov)
- Used by major companies (Alibaba, etc.)
- Saves development time vs building a robust custom lock

**But having both in my project shows:**
- I understand the internals (can implement if needed)
- I make pragmatic choices (use battle-tested libraries when available)
- I know trade-offs (when simple is enough vs when need advanced features)

This is actually a common interview question - 'Why did you use library X instead of building yourself?' The answer is always: 'I CAN build it (and did for learning), but in production I use proven libraries to reduce risk.'"

## 🎓 Deep Dive Topics (For Senior Positions)

### 11. "What are the CAP theorem trade-offs in your system?"

**Answer:**

"My system prioritizes **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** over strong consistency for performance reasons. Let me break down where:

**Seckill Orders (Eventually Consistent - AP):**
- User sees success in <1ms (Redis validation)
- Order appears in DB 50-200ms later (async processing)
- During network partition: Redis continues accepting orders, DB writes queue up
- **Trade-off**: Brief window where user sees success but order not in DB yet
- **Acceptable because**: User experience is immediate, order guaranteed to be processed (Redis Stream persists)

**Cache Data (Eventually Consistent - AP):**
- Cache updates async after DB write
- During cache invalidation race conditions: Might serve stale data briefly
- **Pattern used**: Cache-aside with TTL
- **Trade-off**: User might see old shop info for <2min after update
- **Acceptable because**: Shop data rarely changes, eventual consistency is fine

**Inventory (Strong Consistency - CP):**
- Lua script in Redis provides linearizability for stock
- Single-threaded execution = strong consistency
- **Trade-off**: If Redis down, can't process seckill
- **Acceptable because**: Prefer rejecting orders to overselling

**If I needed stronger consistency:**

1. **Two-Phase Commit**: Coordinate Redis and MySQL
   - Pro: Strong consistency
   - Con: 2x latency, deadlock potential

2. **Saga Pattern**: Compensating transactions
   - Pro: Handles failures gracefully
   - Con: Complex to implement

3. **Distributed Transaction (Seata)**: ACID across services
   - Pro: Familiar transaction model
   - Con: Performance hit (~100ms overhead)

**My design choice:** AP for 99% of operations, CP only for critical inventory. This is the same trade-off Amazon, Alibaba use - eventual consistency for speed, strong consistency only where absolutely needed."

### 12. "How would you debug a production issue where TPS suddenly dropped to 100?"

**Answer (Shows operational experience):**

"I'd follow this systematic debugging approach:

**Step 1: Check Monitoring Dashboards (30 seconds)**

Looking at Grafana:
1. HTTP TPS graph - when did it drop?
2. Error rate - any spike in 5xx?
3. P99 latency - did it shoot up before drop?

**Hypothesis based on patterns:**
- Gradual drop + high latency = resource exhaustion
- Sudden drop + errors = service crash
- Drop + normal latency = upstream issue (load balancer)

**Step 2: Check Application Health (1 minute)**

```bash
# Are instances running?
docker ps
kubectl get pods

# Check logs for errors
docker logs app-1 --tail 100 | grep -i error

# Check JVM health
curl http://app-1:8081/actuator/health
```

**Common culprits:**
- OutOfMemoryError (check heap usage)
- Too many threads (check thread count)
- Deadlock (thread dump analysis)

**Step 3: Check Dependencies (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Redis health
redis-cli PING
redis-cli INFO stats

# MySQL health
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST;  -- Check for long-running queries
mysql> SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;  -- Check for deadlocks

# Network
ping redis
ping mysql
```

**Step 4: Check Resource Utilization (1 minute)**

```bash
# CPU
top  # Any process at 100%?

# Memory
free -h  # Swapping?

# Disk I/O
iostat  # Disk saturated?

# Network
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l  # Connection count
```

**Scenario-Based Debugging:**

**Scenario A: TPS dropped after deployment**
- Check recent code changes
- Compare deployment time with drop time
- Rollback and observe

**Scenario B: Gradual decline over hours**
- Memory leak (check heap growth)
- Connection leak (check connection pool)
- Disk full (check logs filling up)

**Scenario C: Sudden drop at specific time**
- External event (DDoS, marketing email)
- Scheduled job (batch processing started)
- Database backup (locks table)

**Real Example I'd investigate:**

```
Symptom: TPS dropped from 1K to 100
Timeline:
  14:00 - Normal (1K TPS)
  14:05 - TPS drops to 100
  14:05 - P99 latency spikes to 5s
  14:06 - Connection pool 100% utilized
  14:07 - MySQL slow query log shows SELECT * FROM tb_voucher_order

Root Cause: Someone ran an analytics query without LIMIT, scanned 30M rows, locked table
Solution: Kill query, add query timeout, educate team on query best practices
```

**Tools I'd keep ready:**
- `jstack` for thread dumps
- `jmap` for heap dumps
- `tcpdump` for network issues
- `strace` for system call tracing

**Communication during incident:**
1. Acknowledge issue in Slack
2. Update status page
3. Post updates every 15 min
4. Post-mortem doc after resolution"

## 💼 Behavioral Questions (STAR Method)

### 13. "Tell me about a time you optimized a slow system"

**Answer using STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result):**

**Situation:**
"During my time at HUAWEI working on an e-commerce platform, we had a product listing page taking 3-5 seconds to load during peak hours. This was causing a 40% bounce rate."

**Task:**
"I was tasked with reducing the load time to under 500ms to meet business requirements."

**Action:**
"I took a methodical approach:

1. **Profiled the application** using Spring Boot Actuator and identified 3 bottlenecks:
   - 2.5s: N+1 query problem (loading product images separately)
   - 1.2s: Complex sorting in database without index
   - 0.8s: Calling external pricing API synchronously

2. **Implemented solutions:**
   - Fixed N+1 with `@BatchSize` annotation and JOIN FETCH
   - Added composite index on (category_id, created_at DESC)
   - Cached pricing data in Redis with 5-minute TTL
   - Made pricing API call async with CompletableFuture

3. **Validated improvements:**
   - Load tested with JMeter (1,000 concurrent users)
   - Measured before/after with New Relic
   - Monitored production for 2 weeks"

**Result:**
"Reduced load time from 3-5s to 280ms (94% improvement). Bounce rate dropped from 40% to 12%. Revenue increased 15% that quarter, partially attributed to better UX. Documented optimization patterns for team to reuse."

**Follow-up learnings:**
- Always measure before optimizing (avoid premature optimization)
- Low-hanging fruit (caching, indexes) often gives 80% of gains
- Async processing is powerful for user-facing latency

---

### 14. "Describe a time you made a mistake in production"

**Answer (Shows humility and learning):**

**Situation:**
"In my personal project, I was testing the seckill feature and accidentally deployed code to 'production' that had authentication disabled for load testing."

**Task:**
"I needed to fix it immediately before it became a security issue."

**Action:**
"1. Recognized the issue within 5 minutes when I noticed test traffic succeeding without tokens
2. Immediately rolled back the deployment
3. Added a git pre-commit hook to prevent committing with 'TODO: REMOVE' comments
4. Created a checklist for deployments:
   - Review git diff before push
   - Run security scan (OWASP dependency check)
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test authentication in staging
5. Documented the incident in a blameless post-mortem"

**Result:**
"No actual damage occurred as it was caught quickly. But I learned:
- Feature flags are better than commenting code for testing
- Staging environment must match production exactly
- Checklists prevent human error
- Blameless post-mortems improve team culture"

**What I'd do differently:**
"Use Spring Profiles and feature flags:
```java
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.seckill.skip-auth", havingValue = "true")
public class SkipAuthConfig {
    // Only active in test profile
}
```

This way, authentication can't accidentally be disabled in production."

## 🧠 System Design Follow-ups

### 15. "How would you implement rate limiting?"

**Answer:**

"I'd use Redis with a sliding window algorithm for precise rate limiting. Here's the implementation:

**Algorithm: Sliding Window with Redis Sorted Set**

```java
public boolean isAllowed(String userId, int maxRequests, int windowSeconds) {
    String key = "rate_limit:" + userId;
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long windowStart = now - (windowSeconds * 1000);

    // Remove old entries outside window
    stringRedisTemplate.opsForZSet().removeRangeByScore(key, 0, windowStart);

    // Count current requests in window
    Long count = stringRedisTemplate.opsForZSet().zCard(key);

    if (count < maxRequests) {
        // Add current request
        stringRedisTemplate.opsForZSet().add(key, UUID.randomUUID().toString(), now);
        stringRedisTemplate.expire(key, windowSeconds, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        return true;  // Allowed
    }

    return false;  // Rate limit exceeded
}
```

**Why sorted set:**
- Timestamp as score allows range queries
- Precise to the millisecond
- Automatically sorted
- O(log N) operations

**Different rate limiting strategies:**

**1. Fixed Window** (Simple but has burst issue)
```java
// Allow 100 requests per minute
String key = "rate:" + userId + ":" + (now / 60000);
long count = redis.incr(key);
redis.expire(key, 60);
return count <= 100;
```
Problem: Can get 200 requests in 2 seconds if at window boundary

**2. Sliding Log** (Accurate but memory heavy)
- My implementation above
- Stores every request timestamp
- Precise but uses more memory

**3. Token Bucket** (Smooth rate, supports burst)
```java
// Refill 10 tokens/second, max 100 tokens
long tokens = getTokens(userId);
long refillAmount = (now - lastRefill) * 10 / 1000;
tokens = Math.min(100, tokens + refillAmount);

if (tokens >= 1) {
    tokens--;
    return true;
}
return false;
```

**My choice for this project: Token Bucket**

Why:
- Allows burst traffic (user can use accumulated tokens)
- Smooth refill rate
- Memory efficient (only store token count)
- Industry standard (used by AWS, Google Cloud)

**Implementation with Lua for atomicity:**
```lua
local tokens = redis.call('get', KEYS[1])
local capacity = tonumber(ARGV[1])
local rate = tonumber(ARGV[2])
local requested = tonumber(ARGV[3])
local now = tonumber(ARGV[4])

if tokens == false then
    tokens = capacity
end

local last_refill = redis.call('get', KEYS[2]) or now
local time_passed = now - tonumber(last_refill)
local refill_amount = time_passed * rate

tokens = math.min(capacity, tonumber(tokens) + refill_amount)

if tokens >= requested then
    tokens = tokens - requested
    redis.call('set', KEYS[1], tokens)
    redis.call('set', KEYS[2], now)
    return 1  -- Allowed
else
    return 0  -- Denied
end
```

**Rate limits I'd apply:**

```yaml
rate_limits:
  seckill:
    burst: 10 requests/second
    sustained: 5 requests/second

  shop_query:
    burst: 100 requests/second
    sustained: 50 requests/second

  login:
    burst: 5 requests/minute
    sustained: 2 requests/minute  # Prevent brute force
```

**Where to apply:**

1. **API Gateway (Nginx)**: Coarse-grained, per IP
2. **Application (Spring)**: Fine-grained, per user
3. **Redis**: Shared state across all app instances"

### 16. "How would you handle a DDoS attack?"

**Answer:**

"Multi-layer defense strategy, from network to application:

**Layer 1: Network (Before reaching your infrastructure)**
- Use CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai) with DDoS protection
- WAF rules (block common attack patterns)
- GeoIP filtering (block countries if needed)
- Rate limiting by IP at edge

**Layer 2: Load Balancer (Nginx)**
```nginx
# Connection limits
limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;
limit_conn addr 10;  # Max 10 connections per IP

# Request rate limits
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=10r/s;
limit_req zone=api burst=20 nodelay;

# Block known bad actors
geo $bad_actor {
    default 0;
    1.2.3.4 1;  # Blocked IP
}
if ($bad_actor) {
    return 403;
}

# Connection timeout
client_body_timeout 5s;
client_header_timeout 5s;
```

**Layer 3: Application (Spring Boot)**
```java
@Component
public class DDoSProtectionInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, ...) {
        String ip = getClientIp(request);

        // Check Redis for request count
        String key = "ddos:protect:" + ip;
        Long count = redisTemplate.opsForValue().increment(key);

        if (count == 1) {
            redisTemplate.expire(key, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
        }

        if (count > 100) {  // 100 requests per minute per IP
            throw new RateLimitException("Too many requests");
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

**Layer 4: Redis (Resource protection)**
```java
// Implement CAPTCHA for suspicious IPs
if (requestCount > threshold) {
    requireCaptcha(ip);
}

// Bloom filter to detect rapid scanning
if (bloomFilter.mightContain(ip + userId)) {
    return "Duplicate request detected";
}
```

**Detection mechanisms:**

1. **Anomaly Detection**:
```java
// Baseline: Average 1,000 requests/min
// Alert if: Sudden spike to 10,000 requests/min
// Auto-response: Enable stricter rate limits
```

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
- Sequential user IDs (bot scanning)
- Same User-Agent for many requests
- No cookies/JavaScript execution
- Unusually fast requests (sub-100ms between requests)

**Graduated Response:**

```
Level 1: Suspicious Activity
  → Enable CAPTCHA
  → Log for analysis

Level 2: Confirmed Attack
  → Stricter rate limits (1 req/sec)
  → Require authentication for all endpoints
  → Alert ops team

Level 3: Severe Attack
  → Temporarily block IP ranges
  → Enable "under attack" mode (Cloudflare)
  → Serve static "we'll be back" page
```

**Post-incident:**
1. Analyze attack logs
2. Update WAF rules
3. Improve rate limits
4. Document in playbook

**Real-world example:**
```
Situation: Competitor scraped all product data
Detection: 50,000 requests from AWS IP range in 10 min
Response:
  - Rate limit AWS IPs to 10 req/min
  - Require API key for bulk endpoints
  - Add watermarking to product images
Result: Scraping stopped, legitimate AWS users unaffected
```"

### Key Technology Decisions

```
Redis over Memcached: Needed rich data structures (Set, Stream, Geo)
Redis Streams over RabbitMQ: Simpler, already using Redis, <1ms latency
Redisson over custom lock: Production-proven, handles edge cases
Lua scripts: Atomic operations, prevent race conditions
HikariCP: Fastest connection pool, better than Tomcat JDBC
G1GC: Low-latency GC for JVM heap 2-4GB
Nginx over HAProxy: More features, easier config
Docker Compose over K8s: Simpler for single-server deployment
```

---

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

```
PROBLEM: Cache and DB out of sync
SOLUTION: Cache-aside pattern with TTL, accept eventual consistency

PROBLEM: Hot key expiration causes DB stampede
SOLUTION: Mutex lock (only one thread rebuilds cache)

PROBLEM: Redis single point of failure
SOLUTION: Master-replica + Sentinel (not implemented in demo, would in prod)

PROBLEM: Connection pool exhaustion
SOLUTION: Set max connections based on formula:
          max_connections = ((core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count)

PROBLEM: Thread pool saturation
SOLUTION: Monitor with Grafana, scale horizontally when >80% utilized

PROBLEM: Lua script timeout
SOLUTION: Keep scripts <1ms, use SCRIPT KILL for stuck scripts

PROBLEM: Redis memory exhaustion
SOLUTION: Implement LRU eviction policy, monitor with Grafana alerts
